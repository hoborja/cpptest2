1)
 in ascii the letters start at 65, so we set the ASCII_LETTER_START interger to a constant value of 65.
the total number of letters in the alphabet is 26, so we set the NUMBER_LETTERS interger to a constant value of 26
next the program intializes a count interger to the value of 0
then we make a char interger which is intialized with a static_cast to do a convesrion from an interger, in this case our ASCII_LETTER_START interger, to a char datatype, meaning if we print char at the time of intialization it will out put the char ('65'), which is A
while loop is made and the loop will run so long as the interger counter is less than the NUMBER_LETTERS interger which is equal to 26, so this is the same as  counter < 26
in the loop we print to screen ASCII then it prints a number that is equal to our counter interger plus our ASCII_LETTER_START interger, during the first loop that is (0 + 65 which equals 65) then it prints =,
it then out puts currChar which will be the ASCII character equal to what our first equation is, in the first one this is 65 so it will out put an A
so the first one the console will say "ASCII 65 = A"
the next part of out loop will add one to our currChar char
then add one to counter
the loop will then repeat 25 more times until our counter interger is equal to 26 at which point it will stop
at the end this program will have out put the entire alphabet before PAUSING.


2)
a)
We intialize an interger called health to 100
we set the seed of rand to time 0 with srand
we enter a loop which will print to screen Health is now: (the health interger value) which in the first pass it will be 100
it then subtracts our health loop by  a random number with a mod of 10 (10,20,30...)
and it will keep running this loop while our health interger is greater than 0

b)
If we change health's intial value to 0 it does still get into the loop because the while check for a do loop is after the intial run
how ever it will only one run once
so it will only print Health is now: 0

c)
If we change the program to a regular while loop leaving health intialized to 0 the loop will not run and the program will just exit
